                                            The roll-outs will include overall project planning, template creation and project execution. In the planning phase, we mutually agree on and specify a joint project organization to facilitate implementation at each of the client’s site.
                                            The roll-out is scheduled in accordance to the company’s general requirement. The available resources with the client are taken into account and gaps are filled with appropriate consultancy expertise. Gap analysis, change requests etc are taken into consideration to check for deviations from the template.
                                            Support is scheduled right from the beginning of the project. In the template creation phase, we configure a reproducible model which contains the template transactions, functions, programs and customized settings. The Business process master list lists all the template transactions and functions and key documents for all phases of the project (gap analysis, integration test and handover to support team
                                            Data Migration: Standardized tools and programs accelerate data transfer in every roll-out project and improve quality. Documentation of the template processes: Documentation facilitates familiarization with the new system.

                                            For some customers an SAP upgrade is simply a stepping stone to achieving more business value from a current SAP investment. For others, the SAP upgrade is seen as a building block for a whole new system expansion into other functional areas. Whichever path you take, it is our job to perform your upgrade as quickly and painlessly as possible.
                                            <br /> <br /> Advanced Informatics certified consultants can help to successfully deliver your upgrade using best-practice methodologies that are fast, efficient, low cost and tailored to your individual SAP landscape.
                                            <br /> <br /> Since it is often difficult to gauge the impact of an upgrade on your existing environment we will work with you to provide accurate estimates of the costs and effort involved, including project duration, downtime and the impact on other systems. We’ll also help you to understand the road map, architecture and technological impact of the upgrade, and provide good understanding of what transitional services and operational support services are required.
